## Your Level

1. **C# experience:** Comfortable  
2. **OOP comfort:** Learning  
3. **Unit testing:** Done a few  
4. **Algorithm / logic:** Need support  
5. **Which path:** Option 1 (Full Sprint)  
6. **Time available:** 6 h/day study time; 2–3 h/day on this challenge as first priority in first weeks

## Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Path (Sprint vs Code-first) | Option 1 (Full Sprint) | Breadth across all LOs; insight into semester expectations |
| Project type (Console / etc.) | *TBD* | |
| Test framework | *TBD* | |
| Experimental wagons | Implement / Skip | |
